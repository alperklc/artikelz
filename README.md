## Artikelz

I made this for my personal usage, for challenging myself with random nouns of German language. It's been almost a decade since I started learning this language and I'm still failing at finding the right article for a noun. I wrote this on the train ride home, will optimize and make it nice looking later.

Potential improvements:
- Better looking UI
- Storing the high score on the browser cookies and make it more exciting
- Letting user to define the length of the game (20 questions, 50 questions, until closing the browser window)
- Proof the correctness of articles (won't make it, really)
- Enhance the vocabulary
- Wrap the whole thing as a react-native project and distribute on the app stores
- And maybe making it something generic, not just for German articles


I'm encouraging everyone to fork it and create a pull request! Let's hack together :)
